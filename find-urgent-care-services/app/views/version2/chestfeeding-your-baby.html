                        <p>Chestfeeding is feeding your baby with your milk from your chest.</p>
                        <p>If you’re able to chestfeed, it’s your decision whether you do and you can change your mind at any time. You will be fully supported in any decisions you make.</p>

                        <h2>Chestfeeding if you’ve had top surgery</h2>
                        <p>If you’ve had top surgery to remove soft tissue, you may still be able to chestfeed or express your milk. </p>
                        <p>It is not possible to know how much milk you will produce and if it will be enough for your baby. You may need to offer your baby extra feeds, such as with expressed chest milk or formula.</p>
                        <p>Your baby may find it difficult to latch on to your nipple if there is less soft tissue available. In this case, ask your midwife for advice.</p>

                        <p>If you bind (make your chest look flatter) and are chestfeeding, there may be a higher chance of you getting an infection called mastitis.</p>
                        <p>Mastitis causes your chest to become swollen, hot and painful. You may want to try wearing a larger size binder than before.</p>
                        <p>Speak to your midwife or GP if you think you may have mastitis.</p>

                        <p>Skin-to-skin contact with your newborn is a great way to bond with your baby.</p>
                        <p>Skin-to-skin means holding your baby naked or dressed only in a nappy against your skin.</p>
                        <p>It’s good to do at any time and will help to comfort you and your baby over the first few weeks as you get to know each other. </p>
