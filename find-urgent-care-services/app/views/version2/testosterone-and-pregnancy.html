                        <h2>Testosterone therapy and chestfeeding</h2>
                        <p>The previous use of testosterone therapy can affect milk supply in some trans men so you may not be able to chestfeed your baby.</p>
                        <p>If you can chestfeed and you also decide to start taking testosterone after having your baby, then your milk will have small amounts of testosterone in it.</p>
                        <p>It is currently unclear what, if any, risk this could pose to your baby.</p>
                        <p>You may want to discuss the pros and cons of chestfeeding and resuming testosterone therapywith your midwife or doctor.</p>
                        <p>It is also important to consider your own wellbeing if you are finding that not taking testosterone is triggering dysphoria.</p>
